# Customer Intent Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying customer intents based on textual data, such as customer service inquiries or feedback, using machine learning techniques. Accurately identifying customer intent is crucial for improving automated support systems, chatbots, and customer experience workflows.
Project Overview

[Check out the Jupyter Notebook for the complete implementation and analysis here.](https://cystema.github.io/customer-intent-classification/intent-classification.html)

## The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess raw text data (e.g., removing stopwords, punctuation, tokenization).
    - Convert textual data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualize the distribution of customer intents.
    - Analyze the most frequent words and patterns in the dataset.

- Model Training:
    - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines) on labeled customer intent data.
    - Use different feature extraction methods (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec) to improve model performance.

- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    - Visualize the confusion matrix and classification report to assess the model's effectiveness.

- Prediction and Deployment:
    - Test the model on unseen customer queries to classify their intent.
    - Provide examples of how the model can be deployed for real-time intent classification in customer support systems.
